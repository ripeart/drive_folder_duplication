Workspace Replicator for Google DriveOverviewThe Workspace Replicator is a professional-grade Google Apps Script (GAS) application designed to standardize the project onboarding process within organizations. It provides a structured, five-step wizard that allows users to replicate complex folder hierarchies from their own Google Drive root or a specific Folder ID into a new, validated instance.Key FunctionalitiesAdvanced Source DiscoveryRoot Directory Integration: Automatically scans the user's Google Drive root to populate the initial selection list.Dynamic Subfolder Navigation: Includes a cascading dropdown system that fetches sub-directories in real-time once a parent folder is selected.Manual Identifier Support: Allows for the direct input of a Folder ID to clone templates shared from external sources or deep-directory structures.Verification and SafetyLive Preview Engine: Accesses the source template to display a subset of its contents (files and subfolders) before the replication process begins.Recursive Cloning: Utilizes a deep-copy algorithm to ensure all nested assets and folder structures are preserved in the new destination.User ExperienceHaptic Audio Feedback: Uses the Web Audio API to generate a localized, low-volume mechanical click for primary navigation actions.SPA Architecture: Managed as a Single Page Application to ensure fast transitions between steps without full-page browser reloads.Persistent State Management: Maintains user selections across the wizard steps, allowing for easy "Back" navigation and data validation.Technical SpecificationsComponentTechnologyBackend EnvironmentGoogle Apps Script (V8 Engine)User InterfaceHTML5, CSS3 (Custom Properties), JavaScript (ES6+)Google APIsDriveApp (Native GAS Service)Audio ProcessingWeb Audio API (Triangle Oscillator)TypographyInter (Standard Enterprise Sans-Serif)Installation and DeploymentScript SetupOpen the Google Apps Script Dashboard.Create a new project and replace the contents of Code.gs with the provided application code.Save the project with a descriptive name.Web App ConfigurationNavigate to Deploy > New Deployment.Select Web App as the deployment type.Set the following configurations:Execute as: Me (your account)Who has access: Anyone with a Google account (or restricted to your Workspace domain)Copy the generated Web App URL for distribution.Operational WorkflowStep 1: Source IdentificationUsers choose between browsing their root Drive or entering a specific ID. If browsing, a secondary dropdown appears to optionally select a subfolder.Step 2: Resource NamingThe user provides a unique name for the new folder. Input validation ensures that the "Next" action remains disabled until a name is provided.Step 3: Audit and PreviewThe application fetches the template structure. The user reviews the file list to confirm they are cloning the correct project environment.Step 4: System ReplicationThe backend initiates the copyRecursive process. A visual spinner is displayed during this high-latency operation.Step 5: Provisioning CompleteA confirmation screen provides a direct link to the new folder. The "Create Another Instance" option allows for a full state reset to start the process over.Security and ComplianceOrganization-Centric: By deploying within a Google Workspace, the tool respects all existing Drive permissions and data loss prevention (DLP) policies.Zero-Data Storage: The application does not store information on external databases; all operations are performed directly between the source and target directories within the Google ecosystem.Scoped Access: The script only interacts with data the authenticated user has explicit permissions to access.
